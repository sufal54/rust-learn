    "For example, let’s start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple restaurant modules. We’ll extract modules into files instead of having all the modules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root file is src/lib.rs, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate root file is src/main.rs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we’ll extract the front_of_house module to its own file. Remove the code inside the curly brackets for the front_of_house module, leaving only the mod front_of_house; declaration, so that src/lib.rs contains the code shown in Listing 7-21. Note that this won’t compile until we create the src/front_of_house.rs file in Listing 7-22.\n",

In other words, mod is not an “include” operation that you may have seen in other programming languages.\n",

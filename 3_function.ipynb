When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called arguments, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function."

So far, the functions we’ve covered haven’t included an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement.

Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions.\n",
